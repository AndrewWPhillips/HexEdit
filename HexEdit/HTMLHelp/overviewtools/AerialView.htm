<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aerial View is a new feature in HexEdit 3.5. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It 
 allows you to get an overview of even very large files at a glance then 
 drill down to specific parts of a file. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->There 
 are also facilities for displaying the selection, search occurrences, 
 etc (as marching ants or in the border) which is very useful for dealing 
 with large amounts of information at a glance - for example you can use 
 it to check when making a large selection that you are getting the part 
 of the file that you expected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aerial View is also useful to reverse-engineer file formats for which 
 you don't have access to the documentation (or the format was never documented). 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For large 
 files one of the first steps is to get an overview of the file by looking 
 for areas that are different from others that may indicate special data 
 like record headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0;

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Aerial View is turned 
 on (or a file is opened and Aerial View mode is on by default) HexEdit 
 prepares a bitmap (ie, graphical image) of the file where each byte (or 
 group of bytes for very large files) is represented by one pixel. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 happens in the background (ie in a low-priority background thread) so 
 will not affect anything else you want to do with the file. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 Aerial View of the file is displayed in a separate &quot;view&quot; pane 
 (similar to the template view) which can be shown in a split pane to the 
 right of the hex view or in a separate tabbed window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Note that for a large file 
 there might be a delay while HexEdit scans the file but often the Aerial 
 View appears almost immediately. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->While 
 the scan is taking place you can continue working but the aerial view 
 will display as gray the part of the file not yet scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="../ex_red_sm.jpg"
												style="border-style: none;
														border: none;
														width: 17px;
														height: 20px;"
												width=17
												height=20
												border=0> It is very important 
 to understand how the bitmap appears in the Aerial View pane is affected 
 by these two things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">1. The number of bytes per 
 bitmap pixel. Generally there is one byte per pixel but for very large 
 files (approaching or exceeding the GByte size) then HexEdit needs to 
 create a bitmap where each pixel represent 2, 4, 8 or more bytes. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Note 
 that the colour of this combined pixel is the result of the combined colors 
 of each of the bytes so there is still a lot of information being displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">2. How big a bitmap pixel is 
 displayed on the screen. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->On 
 some monitors nowadays a single pixel is almost imperceptible so HexEdit 
 allows you to zoom (see below) the bitmap so that a single &quot;pixel&quot; 
 is displayed on screen in a block of pixels as large as 16 by 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0;
			margin-bottom: 0;
			font-weight: bold;">Zoom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are several abilities 
 of the aerial view window that make it very useful. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->First 
 you can zoom in and out on the view to see more detail, using Ctrl+mouse 
 wheel as usual or using the <a HREF="../misc/context_menus.htm">context 
 menu</a>. If the bitmap is too large to display then you can also scroll 
 up and down using the scrollbar or the mouse wheel. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Also 
 note that the bitmap width adjusts to the width of the window so you can 
 often see new patterns by changing the window width which changes how 
 different pixels align in the bitmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Colors</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make best use of the aerial view it is important to use a suitable 
 color scheme. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you are unaware of it, HexEdit (since version 2.1) has had the ability 
 to set up color schemes where ranges of bytes can be displayed in different 
 colors. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example if the a certain byte value or ranges of values are important 
 then you can set those to display in red. See the <a href="..\dlg_options\HIDD_OPT_PARTITIONS.htm">Color 
 Options page</a> for details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you know nothing at all about the data then using the &quot;rainbow&quot; 
 color scheme that comes with HexEdit is a good way to see the spread of 
 byte values. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 splits the 256 byte values into 12 ranges of about 20 bytes each with 
 the colors for each range varying from red, through various shades of 
 green, blue, etc to purple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With practice you will learn to recognize what different patterns indicate. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Also changing 
 the width of the aerial view window can reveal new patterns by allowing 
 different pixels to come into alignment</p>

			margin-bottom: 0;

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Aerial View is also very useful for working with a file in other 
 ways since it shows information about the selection, bookmarks, highlighted 
 bytes, search occurrences. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can see them in the aerial view as &quot;marching ants&quot; and or in 
 the left margin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="..\tip.gif"
		style="border-style: none;
				border: none;
				width: 31px;
				height: 12px;"
		width=31
		height=12
		border=0>Marching ants are dotted lines that slowly move like a 
 trail of ants. They enclose the relevant bytes and slowly move to make 
 it easier to see the boundaries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, imagine you have performed a search and the search occurrences 
 pane of the status bar informs you that there are thousands of occurrences 
 of the search text. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you want to get an overview of where throughout the file these occurrences 
 are you can simply inspect the aerial view and looking for searches occurrences 
 shown as marching ants and/or in the left margin in the current search 
 color (green by default)).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marching ants and the left margin indicators can be shown individually 
 for each of:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. selection - shown in black and white</p>

<p>2. the mark - cyan in default color scheme</p>

<p>3. <a href="Bookmarks.htm">bookmarks</a> - blue in default color scheme</p>

<p>4. highlighted bytes - normally yellow</p>

<p>5. background search occurrences - green</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To turn on/off these options use the context menu by right-clicking 
 anywhere in the aerial view window.</p>
