<h2><font style="font-family: Arial;"

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keystroke macros provides a quick and simple way to repeat a sequence 
 of actions. (Actually, this name is a bit of a misnomer since more than 
 just “keystrokes” can be recorded.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Macros 
 are not limited to one window or file. You can include commands that open 
 or create files, switch between windows etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Almost all operations invoked with menus, the keyboard, toolbars and 
 even the calculator buttons can be recorded. Changes to settings in the 
 Options Dialog are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> recorded 
 except for the Window Display page. Any settings that are changed in this 
 page are recorded, but unchanged settings are not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also nest macros. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 other words you can call a saved macro from another macro with no limit 
 to the amount of nesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Integration with Calculator etc</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much of the simplicity and power of keystroke macros comes with their 
 integration with other features of HexEdit. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example, all the calculator operations are recorded in macros. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can easily create a macro that reads data from the current file (using 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">@ Cursor</span> button) performs 
 complex manipulations and writes it back. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Running 
 the macro repeatedly on the whole file allows operations such as checksum 
 calculations or even more complicated calculations such as ROT-13.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As another example, suppose you need a macro to change a byte at a particular 
 location in a certain record of a data file but the exact location changes. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If you 
 mark the start of the record with a bookmark (called say &quot;recstart&quot;) 
 then you can use the Hex Jump Tool (or Decimal Jump Tool) to jump to the 
 offset from that bookmark (eg, enter &quot;recstart+5&quot; into the jump 
 tool). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you record the jump in a keystroke macro then the macro always jumps to 
 the correct location as long as the bookmark points to wherever the record 
 starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Useful Keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some keys are particularly useful in macros. Of course, the cursor keys 
 and the keys for cutting and pasting are the chief tools. Keys dealing 
 with the mark are also often very useful. It is common to set the position 
 of the mark and later return to it (with Ctrl+F9), or swap the cursor 
 and the mark (Shift+F9), or select the text between the cursor and the 
 mark (Shift+Ctrl+F9). You may also find the command to increment the current 
 byte (the keyboard shortcut is “+” on the numeric keypad) useful in many 
 ways in macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will often want to observe the progress of the macro but as the 
 macro runs it may creep towards the bottom or top of the display. For 
 a better view of what’s happening you may want to include the scrolling 
 commands (Ctrl+U or Ctrl+D) in the macro to reposition the display. If 
 you intend to replay a macro many times you can have the display refreshed 
 after every replay (see below) and record Ctrl+L as the last key of the 
 macro to centre the cursor and redraw the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an example of a keystroke macro, suppose you wanted to create a file 
 with all 256 byte values. To do this open a new file and insert a null 
 byte (ie. a byte with value zero) and select it. Next, start macro recording 
 and copy the byte to the clipboard (Ctrl+C), move the cursor forward and 
 paste it (Ctrl+V), then invoke the Increment Byte command (“+”), and stop 
 recording. You now have two bytes with the values zero and one. You need 
 254 more bytes so invoke the Multi-Play command from the Tools menu type 
 254 and press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enter</span>. The rest 
 of the file will be filled with bytes ranging from 2 to 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display Refresh</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you need to run a macro hundreds of time on a very large file it 
 may take a very long time to run. A large part of that time (up to 90% 
 or more) may be due to redrawing the screen every time the file is changed 
 or the window is scrolled. To speed things up HexEdit allows you to turn 
 the screen refresh off when macros are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, you may want to see that the macro is behaving as 
 you expected so HexEdit has several options to regularly refresh the screen 
 while the macro is running. You can refresh based on the passage of time 
 (eg. every 5 seconds) the number of keystrokes replayed, or the number 
 of times the whole macro has been played (for multiple replays). The Macro 
 page of the Options dialog controls these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Error Handling</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>If an error occurs during macro playback the macro will stop playing 
 immediately. This helps avoid having runaway macros completely destroy 
 or mangle your file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you can always use the Undo command to reverse any changes 
 that are made if the macro goes haywire. But if you are running a macro 
 hundreds of times it can be tedious to hold down the undo button that 
 many times (although you could record undo in a macro and play it multiple 
 times). Also remember that if the macro includes saving the file (using 
 the Save or Save As commands on the File menu) then any undo information 
 is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having macros stop on error is also useful if you don’t know how many 
 times you want to run the macro. For example, you must use a macro to 
 do a global search and replace, since HexEdit does not provide such a 
 command. If you don’t know how many times the bytes you want to replace 
 occur just play the macro a large number of times, say 1000, and it will 
 stop the first time the search fails, that is, after all the replacements 
 have been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are numerous error conditions that can halt a macro. Some of these 
 are described in the help for the Macro page of the Options dialog. Also 
 some calculator operations may set warnings and errors (for example overflows). 
 Although, user interaction when a macro is playing is minimal sometimes 
 it is necessary to display a dialog to ask a question. If the user cancels 
 the dialog or says not to continue the macro will stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether something is an error or not often depends on what you are doing. 
 For example, if part of the macro is pressing the down arrow key, it is 
 normally an error if you are at the end of the file and the macro will 
 stop. But sometimes this may not be an error and you will want the macro 
 to continue running. To allow for this you can set the error severity 
 level that will stop a macro from running, in the Macro page of the Options 
 dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Displaying Messages</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another useful command is the &quot;Macro Message&quot; command, which 
 allows the macro to display instructions or other info to the user of 
 the macro. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is also useful for warning the user about what will happen if they continue 
 as it lets them terminate the macro.</p>
