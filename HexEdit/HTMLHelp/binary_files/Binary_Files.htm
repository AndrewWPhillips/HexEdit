<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we have seen text files contain only printable character bytes plus 
 a few special control characters (line feed, tab etc). Binary files on 
 the other hand may contain any of the 256-byte values. This might be used 
 to store binary numbers (as was discussed above), true/false flags, native 
 processor instructions or anything that can be stored as a pattern of 
 one or more bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>A common use of binary files is to store the executable image of a program 
 in a .EXE, or .DLL file under MSWindows. Even a word processor may store 
 its documents in binary files, since the document is more than just the 
 text, it also includes formatting information etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also it is usually necessary that bytes in binary files (unlike in text 
 files) are not inserted or deleted. For example, a certain structure may 
 always have a certain length or a number in a file may be a relative offset 
 to another place in the file. This is why HexEdit defaults to overtype 
 mode (OVR) rather than insert mode (INS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is certainly the case with executable files. The machine code instructions 
 contained therein are full of relative jumps, which rely on the address 
 jumped to always being the same offset in the file. Executable files also 
 often have data structures that cannot change in size. For example, you 
 may be able to change the characters in a string in a program, but you 
 cannot insert bytes in order to increase the length of the string, although 
 you may be able to shorten a string by adding nul bytes at the end.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Do Programmers Use Binary Files?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> a lot of good 
 reasons for using binary files. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Ironically, 
 this author thinks binary files are grossly overused when alternatives 
 such as XML offer better flexibility, extensibility and portability of 
 data. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 there are a few good reasons to use them, mainly convenience and efficiency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Probably the most common reason to use a binary file is that it is simple 
 just to output a record or structure from memory directly to a file for 
 later retrieval. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->But 
 in this case you want to make absolutely sure that the file will only 
 ever be read using the same operating system with software created with 
 the same compiler. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Even 
 the same version of compiler may be needed -- for example, the order of 
 bitfields changed between Microsoft C version 2.X and 3.0 (prior to 3.0 
 MSC was a re-badged Lattice C). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 also need to be careful to compile with the same options, since things 
 like structure packing can affect whether you get back the data you expect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A better reason, to use binary files, when writing out a large number 
 of values, is that the time required to convert numbers to and from text 
 may become very large. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is important for large databases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Space efficiency may also be a consideration since storing a large number 
 of randomly distributed numbers as text would use a lot more room (although 
 this could probably be regained by using some sort of compression algorithm). 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->On the 
 other hand writing data as text instead of binary may actually save space 
 (even without compression) -- for example, 64-bit numbers most of which 
 are very small, can be more efficiently stored as text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, storing floating-point numbers as (decimal) text can lead to 
 rounding errors. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you require repeatable results to many decimal places then you need to 
 store floating point numbers as binary (or else as text floating point 
 numbers using hex instead of decimal).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Conclusion</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>I trust the above introduction to binary files will be useful in helping 
 you to get the most out of HexEdit. You should now understand what a binary 
 file is, why they exist, and have an inkling of why you may want to use 
 HexEdit to look at and modify them.</p>
