			face=Arial>Encoding Binary Data</font></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to encode binary data in the form of text 
 to enable transmission over channels that cannot handle 8-bit binary data. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The encoding 
 schemes were invented for two general areas: transmitting binary data 
 between UNIX systems over phone lines (or in general an serial link) and 
 sending data to hardware devices during development of embedded systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although a single protocol would have sufficed a mini-plethora eventually 
 came about, as commonly happens in software development, due to ignorance, 
 egotism and commercial considerations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were some differences which logically affected the designs. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Encoding 
 data for transmission emphasized packing the bits as efficiently as possible 
 as long distance phone calls were timed and expensive. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 embedded systems this was less important as connections were shorter and 
 usually not heavily costed, but they had their own requirements, for example 
 the actual memory address the binary data is to be loaded at, is built 
 into the encoding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Data Transmission</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early UNIX computers used serial (RS232) connections and modems to communicate. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->These were 
 usually just connected up to terminal ports which handled certain control 
 characters (such as Ctrl+D) in special ways which were beyond the control 
 of the application software (either in hardware or the terminal device 
 driver). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Further, 
 if a simple 3 wire connection was used then hardware signalling could 
 not be used and control characters (Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Q) were needed for 
 in-band signalling to avoid buffer overruns. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Also 
 some RS232 connections only handled 7-bit ASCII values, and hence you 
 could not send a byte value with the high bit on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To copy a binary file between UNIX systems uuencode and uudecode were 
 created. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(The 
 &quot;uu&quot; basically signifies that they were part of a suite of utilities 
 all starting with uu and used for UNIX to UNIX communication.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Each 
 line of text has a count, and there are also header and trailer lines. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This encoding 
 stored 3 binary bytes in 4 printable ASCII characters. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Since 
 these files were commonly transmitted using timed telephone calls or over 
 networks which charged on the amount of data sent then it was important 
 to limit the size increase as much as possible. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Files 
 were typically compressed (using the UNIX compress utility) before being 
 uuencoded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When non-UNIX systems wanted to join the party it was found that uuencoding 
 would not always work for systems which did not support ASCII (typically 
 IBM systems and compatibles that used EBCDIC). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->There 
 are several &quot;base64&quot; encoding schemes the most common of which 
 is used in MIME to encode binary files attached to email. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 simply converts groups of 6 bits to a base 64 digit, which again stores 
 3 binary bytes in 4 text characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another similar format is BinHex, commonly used on Macintosh systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> does not (currently) 
 support these formats..</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Embedded Systems</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assembler programmers and electronic engineers also found a need to 
 encode binary data for transmission. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 this case, the purpose was to send object code (and binary data) to hardware 
 devices such as hardware testing systems, EPROM programmers, in-circuit 
 emulators etc. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Two 
 very similar formats were invented: Motorola's S record format and Intel's 
 Hex format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In both of these formats several (typically 16 or 32) bytes of data 
 are stored as a line of text. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Each 
 byte is converted to 2 hex characters and each line of text contains a 
 memory address, a checksum etc. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Hence 
 these formats more than double the size of a binary file when encoded 
 as text. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is not so important as there are typically no costs associated with transmission 
 apart from the extra time taken.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both of these formats contain an address on each line of text which 
 is the address that the first data byte should be loaded. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Motorola 
 supports 3 &quot;record&quot; formats called S1, S2 and S3, which use 
 16, 24 and 32 bit addresses respectively. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Intel 
 Hex only supports 16 bits addresses. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 receiving device uses this address to determine where the data is to be 
 loaded. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 could be used, for example, to store object code in one part of the memory 
 map and data in another. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Note 
 that <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro </span>now supports importing data 
 at discontiguous addresses. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It 
 also supports saving discontiguous chunks (whichever were &quot;selected&quot; 
 using the highlighter) for Motorola S format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Error checking in both formats is accomplished using a checksum for 
 each line. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 Motorola S format also supports a record count as the last record, which 
 will detect if a whole line of text went missing. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Unlike 
 other hex editors, <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro </span>performs complete 
 error checking when reading these types of files including all checksums, 
 Motorola S record count, etc.</p>
