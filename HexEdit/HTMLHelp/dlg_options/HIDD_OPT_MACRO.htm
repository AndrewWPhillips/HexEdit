<p>The Macro options page allows you to change how the keystroke macro 
 is played. You can set how often the display is refreshed while the macro 
 is playing and what sort of error conditions will cause it to stop prematurely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Never</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Selecting this option causes the window 
 display to not be refreshed while the macro is executing. This gives the 
 fastest execution for keystroke macros since the display is not updated, 
 but you will only see what effect your macro had after it has finished. 
 The opposite (ie. slowest) option is to have the display updated after 
 every recorded keystroke (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Every N seconds</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Selecting this option means the display 
 is updated after every N seconds (where N is the value in the seconds 
 field). The refresh happens without regard to the number of keystrokes 
 or replays of the macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Every N keystrokes</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Selecting this option means the display 
 is updated after every N keystrokes (where N is the value in the keystrokes 
 field). Using a value of one with this option means the display is updated 
 as it would be if you were not running a macro, but it gives the slowest 
 performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Every N plays</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">If the macro is being played more than 
 once this option says to update the display after every N replays (where 
 N is the value in the replays fields).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Include Properties Dialog</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This option determines when the Properties 
 dialog is updated. If the Properties dialog is not displayed when the 
 macro runs then this option has no effect. (See the <a href="..\cmd_view\HID_PROPERTIES.htm">Properties 
 command</a> for how to display the Properties dialog.) When selected, 
 the dialog is updated, as determined by the above refresh options, otherwise 
 it is not updated till the macro finishes playing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh: 
 Include Tools and Status Bar</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Selecting this option means that <a href="..\bars\AFX_HIDW_STATUS_BAR.htm">status 
 bar</a> messages plus the <a href="..\tools\HIDC_SEARCH.htm">Find Tool</a>, 
 <a href="..\tools\HIDC_JUMP_HEX.htm">Hex Address Tool</a> and <a href="..\tools\HIDC_JUMP_DEC.htm">Decimal 
 Address Tool</a> and the calculator display are updated when the display 
 is refreshed (as determined by the above refresh options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Halt: All 
 warnings/errors</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This option causes the macro replay to 
 stop prematurely if it causes any sort of error or warning condition. 
 For example, if this option is selected and the macro includes the Read 
 File command, but the file to be inserted has zero size, a warning is 
 generated and the macro stops.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Other warnings include: opening a file 
 that is read-only (the file is still opened but in read-only mode); a 
 failed comparison (see the <a href="..\cmd_tools\HID_EDIT_COMPARE.htm">Compare 
 Windows command</a>); using invalid characters (such as non-EBCDIC characters 
 in a search while in EBCDIC mode); etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Halt: Minor 
 errors</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This option causes the macro replay to 
 stop prematurely if it causes a minor (or worse) error. Minor errors are 
 situations where the command could not be completed but the problem might 
 not be considered fatal. This is the recommended halt option.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Minor errors include such things as attempting 
 to move past the end of file or move/backspace before the start of the 
 file, attempting to decrease the font size below its minimum etc. Often 
 commands cannot be completed because the window is in read-only or overtype 
 mode – when running the macro and this happens you can elect to turn off 
 the mode and continue, but a minor error is generated. (If instead you 
 cancel the dialog a major error is generated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Halt: Major 
 errors only</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This option causes macro replay to stop 
 if there are serious errors but to ignore all warnings and minor errors. 
 This option is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> recommended 
 since many minor errors may cause your macro to behave unexpectedly.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Major errors are any situations where 
 a command could not complete and this could affect subsequent macro commands. 
 Examples include: opening a non-existent file; attempting to modify a 
 read-only file; a failed search; attempting to undo when there is nothing 
 to undo; etc. See above for examples of minor errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save Current 
 Macro</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This button allows you to save the currently 
 recorded macro to a file by invoking the <a href="..\dlg_other\HIDD_MACRO_SAVE_HELP.htm">Save 
 Macro dialog</a>. If no macro has been recorded (or loaded) then this 
 button is disabled. Macro files always have a extension of “.HEM”. The 
 macro file will be saved in the current HexEdit macro folder. See <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Change Macro Folder </span>below for how to 
 change where the macros are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">As well as the macro file name, you may 
 also specify a comment that is stored with the macro as well as the default 
 number of replays and under what error conditions the macro will halt. 
 If you store the macro under the special name AUTOEXEC.HEM then this macro 
 is executed every time you start HexEdit. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you store the macro under a name starting with an underscore (_) followed 
 by a file extension then the macro is executes whenever a file of that 
 type is opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Saved macros can be replayed using the 
 <a HREF="..\cmd_tools\HID_MULTI_PLAY.htm">Play command</a> (which invokes 
 the <a HREF="..\dlg_other\Replay_Macro_dialog.htm">Replay Macro dialog</a>). 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This even 
 allows macros to be nested if a saved a macro is played during recording 
 of another macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Macro</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">This loads a previously saved macro from 
 a macro file. It displays the file open dialog showing (by default) all 
 the macro files in the macro folder. This dialog not only allows you to 
 load a macro, but do other operations, using the context (right-click) 
 menu, such as as deleting or renaming macro files.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">After you select a macro to load, its 
 comment is displayed in a dialog – just click OK. You can then run the 
 macro as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3.00pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change 
 Macro Folder</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">Use this button to change where HexEdit 
 saves and loads its macros from. By default this folder is the same directory 
 as where HexEdit.exe is located.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 18.00pt;">The specified folder is also used to store 
 the file containing any custom toolbar images (ToolbarImages.bmp). This 
 folder should be different for each user of HexEdit on the same computer 
 so that toolbar customizations are kept isolated from each other.</p>
