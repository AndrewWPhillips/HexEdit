<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When editing a file HexEdit behaves much like a word-processor or editor. 
 You can move the cursor around using the keyboard or the mouse (see <a 
 href="move.htm">Moving Around</a>). You can select text with the keyboard 
 or mouse and cut, paste etc (see <a href="clipboard.htm">Selecting and 
 the Clipboard</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>One difference is that there are two separate areas for editing – the 
 hex area and the character area (although either area can be disabled). 
 You can enter any byte value in the hex area but only by typing two hex 
 digits – HexEdit beeps if you type any other characters. On the other 
 hand you can only enter text charcaters (ASCII or EBCDIC) in the character 
 area.</p>

 key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modes</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two sets of toggled states that affect editing behaviour. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The first 
 toggles between read-only and read-write modes; the 2nd toggles between 
 overtype and insert modes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are in read-only mode then you cannot modify the file at all. 
 This mode is separately controllable for each window so you can have two 
 windows on the same file in different modes. But if the <span style="font-style: italic;">file</span> 
 itself is opened read-only then all windows for the file must remain read-only. 
 The RO/RW indicator on the status bar indicates the current mode – you 
 can double-click this indicator to toggle the state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Insert/Overtype mode is changed (similarly to the read-only mode) 
 by double clicking the INS/OVR status bar indicator toggles the state. 
 Both modes have uses and limitations as explained below..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In insert mode the length of the file may change. As you enter bytes 
 the following ones are shifted forward. Similarly deleting, cutting etc 
 removes data and shifts the following bytes backward. But in overtype 
 mode existing bytes are never moved, instead changing bytes destroys their 
 previous value. Further if you try to delete or cut to the clipboard in 
 overtype mode HexEdit asks if you want to switch to insert mode. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Pasting 
 in overtype mode asks if you want to overwrite or switch to insert mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In many types of binary files it is essential that any changes do not 
 move bytes around and the length of the file does not change – for safety 
 always edit these types of files in overtype mode. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Another 
 problem with insert mode is that if you insert or deletes bytes near the 
 start of a very large file then the whole file needs to be rewritten which 
 may take a lot of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand it is often very useful to be able to insert bytes 
 within a binary file. Also, to add to the end of a file you must be in 
 insert mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you make changes to a file, HexEdit keeps track of these changes 
 and allows you to undo them. In fact HexEdit uses this undo information 
 plus the original file on disk to show you what the file is currently 
 like. This means that you can quickly edit very large files since, unlike 
 many editors, the whole file does not have to be read into memory (or 
 some sort of virtual memory). But this system does have the disadvantage 
 that you cannot undo changes that were made before you last saved the 
 file to disk. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Also 
 as you make more and more changes the display takes longer and longer 
 to regenerate -- but this is not normally a problem unless you run a macro 
 or replace operation that makes lots of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well as a file-level undo, which keeps track of changes to the file, 
 HexEdit also has a window-level undo that keeps track of cursor movement, 
 changes made to the display etc. However, since changes made to the file 
 can affect the display in another window for the same file HexEdit must 
 take special precautions to keep its internal structures consistent. If 
 you undo a change to the file in one window, all display changes in other 
 windows on that file are undone back to the point in time when the original 
 file change was made. Moreover, if you try to undo back past a change 
 made in another window HexEdit will ask you if you really want to undo 
 the change.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Change Tracking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>HexEdit can show all the changes you have made to a file, since you 
 opened (or last saved) it. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It 
 shows where bytes have been replaced, inserted and deleted. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Note 
 that, it does not show how the changes were made - for example, if you 
 delete 20 bytes then insert 20 bytes at the same location then this will 
 be shown as 20 bytes having been replaced, since that is the effective 
 difference with what is stored on disk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Replacements are shown with a red underline, insertions with a (lighter 
 shade of) red background, and deletions are marked with a red block at 
 the deletion points. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 the hex area the deletion also shows a count of the number of bytes deleted 
 when it is less than 10. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 change tracking color can be changed from the default of red by changing 
 it in the current color scheme using the <a HREF="../dlg_options/HIDD_OPT_PARTITIONS.htm">Color 
 Options page</a> of the Options dialog.</p>

<p>Display of change tracking can be toggled using the <a HREF="../cmd_misc/HID_TRACK_CHANGES.htm"><img

 <a HREF="../dlg_options/HIDD_OPT_WINEDIT.htm">Document Edit Options page</a> 
 of the Options dialog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">File Handling</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>HexEdit behaves like many Windows programs, such as word-processors, 
 when it comes to the opening, closing, saving etc of files. The only difference 
 is that instead of HexEdit being associated with a particular type of 
 “document”, you can work with any type of file. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 the File Open Dialog you will see (by default) all files, since the default 
 file type is “All Files (*.*)”. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You 
 can, however, select different file filters from the &quot;Files of Type&quot; 
 drop down list -- you can even control what filters are shown in the filter 
 list with the <a HREF="../dlg_options/Filters.htm">Filters page</a> of 
 the Options dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Read only</span> check box in the 
 File Open dialog allows you to open a file for read only. You may want 
 to do this so that you don’t accidentally modify the file. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 the file <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> be opened read-only 
 because it is a hidden or system file or because something else is reading 
 it then HexEdit will warn you. Note that even if a file is not opened 
 read-only a window on that file may be read-only (see above).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Normally HexEdit likes to prevent a file from being modified while it 
 has the file open. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is because HexEdit does not cache the file in memory but will update the 
 display directly from the disk file. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 sometimes you may want to allow other programs to access the file at the 
 same time which is when you should use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shareable</span> 
 check box. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 not that in this case if something else modifies the file contents may 
 change unexpectedly.</p>
