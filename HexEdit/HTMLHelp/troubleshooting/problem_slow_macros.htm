<h2>Macros slow down while running</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> macros typically run very fast, 
 but due to the way <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> stores information 
 about the changes made to a file, as changes are made each subsequent 
 change takes slightly longer. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is not noticeable when editing manually but is evident to a small number 
 of users who use a macro that modifies a large file and which is run a 
 large number of times. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is simply due to the fact that HexEdit was originally optimised for display 
 speed, not speed of changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The technical reason is that whenever you add, delete or modify some 
 bytes this is added to the stack of undo info, then a list is built of 
 all the places that the current file comes from. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->As 
 the undo stack gets bigger this list takes longer and longer to rebuild 
 after each change. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 when you save the file to disk the undo info can be discarded (as the 
 file you are editing is now the same as the file on disk) and file modifications 
 are fast once more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To avoid this effect the answer is to simply save the file to disk in 
 your keystroke macro. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 this means you can then not undo any changes. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Note 
 that macros that do not modify a file always run fast.</p>
