<p id=p2><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit</span> is a binary file editor 
 or hex editor. It’s called a binary file editor because it allows you 
 to edit binary files. It’s called a hex editor because you see and edit 
 the bytes of the binary file using hexadecimal (or hex) values.</p>

<p id=p3>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p4><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit</span> allows you to easily change 
 any byte in any file on any disk, as long as you have permission to modify 
 that file. Unless you are logged in as an administrator there will be 
 some files you do not have permission to modify or even read.</p>

<p id=p5>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p6><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit</span> is a shareware program. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->You can 
 try it for free for 30 days. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you decide to continue using it you can pay for <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit 
 Pro</span> here: <a href="http://www.hexedit.com/register.html"

<h3 id=p8><span style="font-weight: bold;">Binary Files and Text Files</span></h3>

<p id=p10>A binary file typically contains any of the 256 different possible 
 byte values. Another way to think of a binary file is that it is any file 
 that is not a text file. A text file is a file that contains only printable 
 characters plus a few special “control” characters such as tab and end-of-line.</p>

<p id=p11>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p12>You can use a binary file editor such as <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit 
 Pro</span> to edit a text file but you are better off using a text editor 
 for that. You can edit text files using <span style="font-weight: bold;">NotePad</span>, 
 or there are also many free and commercial text editors available.</p>

<p id=p13>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p14>You can use word processors like <span style="font-weight: bold;">WordPad</span> 
 to edit text files too. Word processors, however, are mainly designed 
 to work with special files of their own design. These are special purpose 
 binary files, which allow the word processor to not only store the words 
 etc of a document but other information such as font sizes, formatting 
 etc.</p>

<p id=p15>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p16>Generally if a program stores information in files, in its own 
 internal format, then it is stored in a binary file. (Although sometimes 
 data is stored as a strange-looking text file [eg. PostScript, XML etc], 
 using certain printable characters for special purposes.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example, Microsoft Word used to store its documents in a binary file having 
 a file extension of .DOC, but nowadays uses a DOCX file (which is actually 
 just a zip file containing XML files).</p>

<p id=p17>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p18>Windows itself defines several binary file formats for its own 
 purposes. For example, the machine instructions (and some unchanging data) 
 of a program are stored in a type of binary file called an executable 
 file, which has a file extension of .EXE.</p>

<p id=p19>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id=p20>What can I use <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit</span> for?</h3>

<p id=p22>You use a binary file editor when there is no other way to inspect 
 or change a binary file or a specific part of that file. Usually you would 
 use special software associated with that type of file (eg. Word allows 
 you to edit its own .DOC/.DOCX files) but that may not always be possible.</p>

<p id=p23>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p24>Many game players use a hex editor to enhance their experience 
 by getting extra lives or powers that they would not normally be able 
 to obtain. When you save your position in a game the current status is 
 typically stored in a binary file. You can often work out (or find out 
 on the Internet) the format of this file and edit it to make the game 
 easier (or harder if you think you are really good).</p>

<p id=p25>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p26>Some people use binary file editors to change .EXE files. For 
 example, you can edit the messages or graphics that a program displays. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 editing these types of files is not as simple as editing text files. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example, you should never change text messages to be longer than the original.</p>

<p id=p27>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p28>You can also use a hex editor to fix corrupt files. For example, 
 if an MSWord .DOC file has been corrupted badly Word will refuse to load 
 it. Some books and Internet sites document the format of .DOC files. You 
 can use this information to “patch” the file to recover some or all of 
 your work.</p>

<p id=p29>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p30>Programmers make heavy use of hex editors when testing software 
 that uses binary files. They are used to create input test data. They 
 are also used to verify and check output data files to try to discover 
 the cause of bugs, or to fix malformed files so that testing can continue.</p>

<p id=p30>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id=p32><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I use a hex editor?</span></h3>

<p id=p34>First you need to know roughly what hex is and some of the different 
 types of things that can be stored in a file, such as fixed and floating 
 point numbers, character sets, date formats etc. These are explained in 
 the later section called <span style="font-weight: bold;">All About Binary 
 Files</span> (see <a HREF="..\binary_files\Numbers.htm">Numbers</a>, <a 
 HREF="..\binary_files\Floating_Point_Numbers.htm">Floating Point Numbers</a>, 
 <a HREF="..\binary_files\Date_and_Time_Formats.htm">Date and Time Formats</a> 
 etc).</p>

<p id=p35>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p36>To view and edit a particular type of binary file you normally 
 have to know something about its internal format. If you do not have a 
 description of the format you may be able to find it by searching the 
 Internet. You may be able to get a precise file definition (for example, 
 the format of Windows .EXE files), or just a rough idea (for example, 
 the format of saved game file from gaming sites).</p>

<p id=p37>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p38>If you find information on how to modify a binary file you may 
 be given an address or offset of the byte(s) to modify. This address is 
 just the number of the byte within the file. Note that by convention the 
 very first byte of the file has an address or offset of zero, the next 
 is one etc. In <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit</span> the address of the 
 first byte of each line is shown at the left side of the window. The current 
 address of the cursor is also shown in the hex and decimal address tools 
 on the ToolBar.</p>

<p id=p39>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p40>If you have no information about the format you may be able to 
 work out something about it yourself by creating different files perhaps 
 with slight variations and comparing them. Where the file comes from (ie. 
 the operating system and application), and what it is used for, may give 
 clues about what it contains.</p>

<p id=p41>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p42>Often the only alternative is to just experiment. However, before 
 making any changes to a file <span style="font-weight: bold;">make sure 
 you create a backup copy first</span>. If the changes you made do not 
 have the intended effect then you will have to revert to this backup file.</p>

<p id=p43>&nbsp;</p>

<p id=p44>Also remember that making random changes to a .EXE file can be 
 dangerous. Changing messages or graphics is usually safe as long as the 
 length of the file does not change. But changing machine instructions 
 or data will typically cause the program to crash when you run it. If 
 it crashes while writing to data files then these can be corrupted too.</p>
