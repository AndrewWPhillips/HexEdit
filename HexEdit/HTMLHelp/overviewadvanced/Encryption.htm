<h2><font style="font-family: Arial;"
			face=Arial>Encryption</font></h2>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> allows you to encrypt and decrypt 
 all or part of a file by selecting the bytes and using the encryption 
 or decryption command. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It 
 provides all the stream and block encryption algorithms available under 
 the Windows &quot;Crypto API&quot; as well as a good internal encryption 
 algorithm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Crypto API and CSPs</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crypto API was introduced with Windows NT 4.0, mainly to address 
 security issues to do with the growing use of the Internet. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 API does not itself do anything but simply provides a standard way for 
 Windows programs to talk with Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs). 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->CSPs are 
 DLLs provided by third party software providers (although Microsoft provides 
 the &quot;Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0&quot; CSP).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on the software you have installed on your computer, you will 
 typically have a few CSPs, perhaps many, installed. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Each 
 CSP provides one or more encryption algorithms or ciphers. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Different 
 CSPs may provide different implementations of the same algorithms, but, 
 in general, you should always decrypt using the same CSP and algorithm 
 that you encrypted with. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 you are encrypting on one machine and decrypting on another you must ensure 
 the same CSP/algorithm is available on both machines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are using Windows 95, and <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> 
 only shows one encryption algorithm (the <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> 
 internal algorithm) then the Crypto API is not available on your computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Algorithms</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> only supports use of the single-key 
 or symmetric ciphers. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(This 
 is the traditional type of computer encryption where the same password 
 or key is used to encrypt and decrypt.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<span 
 class=HexEdit><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->HexEdit Pro</span> does not 
 support public-key ciphers, as these are only provided in the Crypto API 
 for encryption of session keys. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 Crypto API provides for two types of single-key cipher: block and stream.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Block encryption works by encrypting all the bits of a fixed size block 
 at once. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 the number of bytes to be encrypted is not a multiple of the block size 
 then pad bytes will need to be added, hence block ciphers provided by 
 the Crypto API increase the numbers of bytes when encrypting by up to 
 2 blocks. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Hence, 
 when encrypting in <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> with a Crypto 
 API block cipher the length of the selected bytes will increase after 
 encryption, and decrease back to the original size after decryption. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->(This 
 is not true for the <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> internal algorithm 
 - see below.) <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0 provides the RC2 block encryption 
 algorithm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stream encryption, as its name suggests can take an unencrypted stream 
 of data and produce an encrypted stream. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Hence, 
 unlike block encryption, you can encrypt any number of bytes with stream 
 encryption. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span>, when you encrypt with a stream 
 cipher, the encrypted length is the same as before encryption. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 disadvantage of stream encryption is that the algorithms are typically 
 not as secure, and implementations are slower than block encryption. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0 provides the RC4 stream cipher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> internal algorithm is a block 
 cipher with a block size of 8 bytes (64 bits). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->As 
 it does not provide padding of any incomplete last block it does not need 
 to increase the length of the encrypted data. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 to encrypt or decrypt using this algorithm the length of the current selection 
 must be a multiple of 8 bytes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Passwords</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The password is the &quot;key&quot; that is used to encrypt and decrypt. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->It does 
 not matter how good your encryption algorithm is if you choose an easily 
 guessed password. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Hence 
 a good password is at least 8 characters long, is not a common word or 
 name in a common language, and should include some non-alphabetic characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> has a minimum password length 
 which defaults to 8. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 as encryption requirements vary this can be changed. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example, if you are only using <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> 
 for testing Crypto API functions then you might want to reduce the minimum 
 required password length.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also mask your passwords using the &quot;Mask password&quot; 
 check box. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 is useful if anyone could possibly view your screen while you are entering 
 the password. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 since you have no feedback about what you have typed, you have to enter 
 a masked password twice to catch typos, otherwise you may not be able 
 to decrypt your valuable data again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Particular care must be taken with passwords and keystroke macros. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 a password is entered while recording a macro, and the macro saved to 
 file then the password is stored in the file for all to see. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Typically, 
 you would <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> enter a password 
 while recording a macro, and to ensure that the user is prompted for a 
 password when encrypting or decrypting you can record the &quot;Clear 
 Password&quot; command in the macro; if no password has been entered since 
 last cleared when the Encrypt or Decrypt command is invoked then <span 
 class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> will prompt for one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Public Key 
 Encryption</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another form of encryption that <span class=HexEdit>HexEdit Pro</span> 
 does not (yet) support is public key encryption. This has many excellent 
 uses that I will not go into here. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 this form of encryption the two keys (encryption/decryption) are not the 
 same. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->One 
 key (the public key) can be easily deduced from the other key (the private 
 key) but it is computationally infeasible to deduce the private key from 
 the public key. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->A 
 common public key encryption algorithm is RSA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, known public key algorithms are very slow compared to 
 single-key algorithms. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->However, 
 it is not necessary to encrypt all the data using public key encryption. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The data 
 itself can be encrypted using a single-key algorithm using a key that 
 is itself encrypted using a public-key algorithm. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This 
 system of using two algorithms (a public key one and a single-key one) 
 effectively gives the advantages of public key encryption at close to 
 the speed of single-key encryption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To do this the single-key encryption is performed using a randomly picked 
 number for the encryption key. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 example, to encrypt and send data, a random number is generated and encrypted 
 using the public key encryption algorithm using the receiver's public 
 key, and sent. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Then 
 the data itself is encrypted with the single-key algorithm using this 
 random key. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->As 
 the random value is generated and only used for only a short time, or 
 session, it is called a session key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crypto API uses public key encryption in this manner. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->That 
 is public key encryption is only used to encrypt session keys for single-key 
 encryption algorithms.</p>
